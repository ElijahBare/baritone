# Elytra Baritone

I saw leijruvs vid about the auto elytra flight and looked at it and it was all test code, no command or anything. so i hacked this together this morning and here we are.

check releases for the elytra jar, or build from source

Compile the pathfinder yourself:

```
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -g -O0 -L. -o nether_pathfinder_exe *.cpp *.h
```

## DISCLAIMER: I DIDNT WRITE BARITONE NOR THE PATHFINDING CODE. JUST MAKIGN IT EASILY ACCESSABLE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO TRY IT EARLY ON.
